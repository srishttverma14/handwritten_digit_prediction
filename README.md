# Handwritten Digit Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Prediction repository! This project demonstrates how to build and train a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) which walks through the process of building a machine learning model for handwritten digit classification. The notebook utilizes popular libraries and techniques to preprocess the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contents

- `Handwritten_Digit_Prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow for digit prediction, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (or `keras` if you're using an older version)
- `jupyter` (for running the notebook)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`. Here's a sample command to install them:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/srishttverma14/handwritten_digit_prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd handwritten_digit_prediction
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `Handwritten_Digit_Prediction.ipynb` file.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and explore the handwritten digit prediction model.

## Notebook Overview

The `Handwritten_Digit_Prediction.ipynb` notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Import the MNIST dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and prepare the data for training.
3. **Model Building**: Create a machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) to predict digits.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data and visualize results.
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
